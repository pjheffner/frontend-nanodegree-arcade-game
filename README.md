Game Description
Goal - The goal of the game is to get the 'Princess' to the water. When the goal is achieved, a 'winning' sound will play.

The princess is moved by using the arrow keys and must avoid the 'enemies' on the sidewalk. 
If she collides with an enemy, a 'losing' sound will play and she will be sent back to her starting position.
There are 3 enemies on the sidewalk. They move in varying speeds, and while they each start out in their own
sidewalk row, each time the cross the game board, the will come back on a random row. Therefore sometimes 
more than 1 enemy will appear in the same row.
